# Personal repo for competitive programming
I'll add to this repo any single problem that I solve in any contest from now on.

_Previous work will not be uploaded as I want to keep track of new progress._

Folders are named after the website I found the problem, an I've tried to stick with the given naming inside the website.

Some problems might appear more than once if they're referenced in two different places; i.e. they might be from SPOJ, but I encountered it in a vjudge contest, so they'll be in both of those folders.
